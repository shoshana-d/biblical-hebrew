<p>If you've decided to learn (or relearn!) Biblical Hebrew, this website is for you.</p>
 
  <p>
Audio is a feature of this site. You can click on every Hebrew word to hear it pronounced.
 </p>

<h3>How is this course different from all other courses?</h3>
 <p>Traditional methods seem to have as their aim to be able to translate a random bit of the text without knwoing its reference - while this would
be a cool party trick  it's not really something that you need to be able to do (unless you want to become aHbrew scholar?)  </p>
<p>different varieties of Hebrew, even in tanakh (but note that in prayerbook hebrew that is not direct quotes from Tanakh 
not necessarily exactly the same hebrew and some aramaic)</p>


<h3><span class="button-plus" onclick="ShowHideParentNextSibling(this)"></span> What will I learn in these lessons?  Are these lessons for me?</h3>
 <div class="hidden section" >
 <p>
 As the title says, these lessons are about getting started in understanding the Hebrew in the Tanakh. 
 
 aim of the lessons - using the translation, figure out which word is which in the Hebrew, 
 ie to understand how each word in the Hebrew contributes to the meaning of the verse
</p>

 <p>
 Dual strategy 
 <ul>
 <li> learn around 50 of the most frequently occurring words, these account for around half of the Tanakh, important to be able to recognize them
 as they may be disguised with prefixes and/or suffixes. Can then often figure out the other words in a verse by
 process of elimination
 </li>
 <li> learn strategies to identify other nouns and verbs 
 
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>
 <p>
 learn most frequently occurring words in Tanakh, 

Biblical Hebrew basic grammar (how bh works) 50 most frequently occurring words account for >50% of Tanakh-  
if you learn some of the extra vocab words will know more than 50 + some more frequently occurring "little" words
aim to recognize words you know -this is not always obvious as they may be disguised with prefixes and suffixes and changes of vowel 
</p>
<p>Start by picking out one or two words in a verse, gradually able to recognize more, and to deduce others that you don't know
</p>
<p>need to be comfortable at first with not understanding every word</p>
<p>verbs by process of elimination</p>
<p>12 ? most frequently occurring nouns, 5 most frequently occurring verbs, and the most frequently occurring "little" words - prepositions and others.
Plus extra vocab the next 25 most frequently occurring nouns and the next 15? most frequently occurring verbs and some more numbers and adjectives.
By learning these "little" words should be abel to figure out which words are nouns and which verbs by process of elimination.
</p>
<p>because the most frequent words occur very frequently means that you will quite soon have "friends" in the text, it will not seem so daunting
</p>
<p>also some less frequently occurring "little" (words (words which are not nouns or verbs) so that you can more easily pick out unknown nouns and verbs </p>
 <p>examples and frequencies taken from sections of the Tanakh I think most likely to be read by Jewixh people - Torah, 
 Jonah, Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther + haftarah readings from Prophets
</p>
  <p>advantages of this approach. more enjoyable, more likely to engage with the text 
  when you don't have to keep looking up words in a dictionary (very souldestroying). 
  more likely to become familiar with the text and hence eventually be able to recognize passages 
  even though don't know all the words (this is the traditional method of learning - large amounts of text learned by heart)
  </p>

<h3><a href="alefbet.html">Alefbet pages</a></h3>
 
  <p>These pages  cover only pronunciation, 
  that is, sounding out words without necessarily understanding their meanings. 
  Pronunciation is really important- the text of the Tanakh is meant to be spoken  or chanted.</p>


<h3><a href="resources.html">Resources page</a></h3>
<p>This page has the text of the blessing before Torah study, and a few links to free internet resources related to pronunciation. </p>



<p>Let me know if you find these pages useful, and/or if you have comments or suggestions or find errors.</p>
