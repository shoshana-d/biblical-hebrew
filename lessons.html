 <p>KJV When the King James Bible was translated and first published in 1611, no Jews lived in England – at least officially.
 So, we know that no Jews served as Tanach translators. Jews were readmitted to England in 1655.
 In 1917, the Jewish Publication Society brought out a Bible English- language translation that became 
 the most popular in the English-speaking world. 
 The JPS literary form consciously was based on the KJV.
 “Translators didn’t live in some vacuum. There are always contexts and issues of identity to deal with. 
 Somebody who studies these translations must know the culture in which the translations worked. 
 You must always ask: What are the translators bringing in from the culture around them?”

A decisive break with the KJV didn’t come until the JPS Tanach, completed in 1962. 
The JPS Tanach is radically different. 
Rather than following a literal (or formal) approach to the text, like KJV and the 1917 translation,
 the new JPS Tanach was a functional equivalent.
 A formal translation is one in which the English follows the form of the Hebrew. 
 The form is intrinsic to its meaning. 
 A functional equivalent consciously shapes the text so that it sounds like a piece of modern literature. 
 So, there’s a lot of subordination rather than coordination.
 Metaphors, for example, are put into terms that we would understand.
 A translator might ask: What did this expression mean in biblical times? 
 How would we express this today?
 Consequently the text winds up sounding more modern because it is brought close to the reader. 
 It’s not literally what the Hebrew says.

Greenspoon says it’s hard to imagine somebody who is not a fan of the KJV in some ways.

“One should ask: What is the purpose of the translation? 
Is it something designed to read out loud in a service? 
Or silently in a private reading? 
You also want to know how your translation handles the traditional Jewish interpretation of the passage.

 <h3><span class="button-plus" onclick="ShowHideParentNextSibling(this)"></span> Limited vocabulary in Tanakh compared to English</h3>
 <div class="hidden lessons-before-we-start-div" >
Because the Tanakh has a much smaller vocbulary than English, a Biblical Hebrew word often has several different English translations

 <p>Good - less vocab to learn, AND learning the most frequent means yourecognize a large percentage of text</p>
 <p>Bad, the most frequent words often have multiple translations, so need to be a detective</p>
  <p>same hebrew word often translated differently according to context. Often this is because of the small vocab in the Tanakh </p>

 <p>Should do all the exercises. Exercises give the translation and ask you to find specific words from the
translation in the Hebrew. To get the most out of the material you should listen to all the Hebrew until you
can read each passage aloud at approximately the same speed as the recording, and you can distinguish the 
Hebrew word(s) in the recording.
Some sections have "more detail". These are not essential, suggest at first leave them out, come back to them later.

<p>Since we will be working from English translations, we need to understand the ways on which
Tanakh Hebrew is different from English:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Biblical Hebrew verbs are always a single word. 
This word often corresponds to 2 or more words in the English translation.
<li>A single Hebrew word often corresponds to two or more English words. 
This is because some English words are not separate words in Biblical Hebrew. In Biblical Hebrew, 
  these "words" are added as <b>prefixes</b> (at the beginning of a Hebrew word)  or <b>suffixes</b> (at the end of a word) 
<li>The order of words in sentences is often different, 
in particular, the verb often comes before the subject (Spoke God to Moses.)
